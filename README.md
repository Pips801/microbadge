# Microbadge
Do you find Minibadges too big? Do you want to go even smaller? Try out the Microbadge! A minibadge can hold 4 of them!

The Microbadge is a 6mm x 6mm badge that uses 1.00mm pin headers to connect to a carrier board.

There are two Microbadge types - Simple and Full. Simple exposes +VBATT, CLK, 3x GND, and 2x +3v. The Full Microbadge adds two programming pins, and I2C SDA and SCL.

 # Importing into Kicad
 1. From the **Project Viewer**, **Symbol Editor** or the **Schematic Editor**, select **Preferences** > **Manage Symbol Libraries...**

 2. Under **Global Libraries**, click **Add Existing Library to Table**, Select the `Microbadge V2.kicad-sym` file. I personally put it in `Documents\KiCad\{version}\symbols` on Windows, there's an equivalent folder on Mac and Linux as well.
 3. From the **Project Viewer**, **Footprint Editor**, or **PCB Editor**, select **Preferences** > **Manage Footprint Libraries...**

 4. Under **Global Libraries**, click **Add Existing**, Select the `Microbadge V2.pretty` folder. I personally put it in `Documents\KiCad\{version}\footprints` on Windows, there's an equivalent folder on Mac and Linux as well.

# Creating a Microbadge carrier board (Minibadge)
This assumes you already have the SAINTCON Minibadge footprints and symbols added to your libraries.
 1. Open the **Schematic Editor**, and import a Minibadge symbol and at least one Microbadge symbol.
 2. Atatch **Power Symbols** and **Global Labels** to the Minibadge symbol. If you want blinking, don't forget to connect CLK.

 3. Atatch the same Symbols to each Microbadge symbol you created. Each symbol will be a microbadge socket.

 4. Select **Assign Footprints** > Assign a **Minibadge Footprint** (`Minibadge_Simple`, `Minibadge_Full`) to the **Minibadge** (not a slot), and assign a **Microbadge socket** footprint to the **Microbadges**.

 5. Do your schematic and PCB work. Add LEDs, resistors, and other components.

# Creating a Microbadge

 2. Atatch **Power Symbols** and **Global Labels** to the microbadge. If you want blinking, don't forget to connect **CLK**.

 3. Wire up your LEDs, resistors, and other components you want to use.
 4. Select **Assign Footprints** > Assign a Microbadge footprint (Square or Round, **not** a Socket!) to the **Microbadge**
 5. Assign `0603` or `0201` sized components to your LEDs and resistors. You have very little space to work with, so the smaller, the better.
 6. Do your PCB routing, silkscreening, etc.
